# Naive Bayes Classifier for MNIST Dataset

This project implements a naive Bayes classifier that utilizes 2 features from the MNIST Dataset to classify 0s and 1s. The classification is based on the calculation of mean and variance of brightness for each image individually, as well as the mean and variance for the entire group. The classifier is then fed with test sets and assessed for accuracy.

## Features

- Utilizes the MNIST Dataset.
- Calculates mean and variance of brightness for each image.
- Evaluates accuracy using naive Bayes classification.
- Expected accuracy: 90% or higher for predicting images of class 0 or 1.

## Installation

To use the Naive Bayes Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FalseShepherd/naive-bayes-classifier.git
